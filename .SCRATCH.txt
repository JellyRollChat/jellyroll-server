where we're at now is we need a way to first get the server to relay a message from user to user.then we need sign a message then the other side needs to verify incoming messages read a list of pubkeys as a buddy list 
- add aliases as k:v ?
client:receive
- receive message from server
- sender in buddylist?
  if yes, verify sig
  if no, disconnectclient:send 
- sign message 
- send message to server
server:receive 
- receive first message from user 
- sender in userlist?
  if yes, verify cert
    if cert good, continue connection 
    if cert bad, disconnect 
  if no, enlist user
