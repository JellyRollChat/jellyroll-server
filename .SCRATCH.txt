ok so where im leaving off right now is cleaving off the key creation stuff on the server side. britt was busting my balls about how hes gonna ddos it so fuck it, users create their own keys, and can verify sigs with the server.

where we're at now is we need a way to first get the server to relay a message from user to user.

then we need sign a message 

then the other side needs to verify incoming messages 

read a list of pubkeys as a buddy list 
- add aliases as k:v ?


client:receive
- receive message from server
- sender in buddylist?
  if yes, verify sig
  if no, disconnect

client:send 
- sign message 
- send message to server


server:receive 
- receive first message from user 
- sender in userlist?
  if yes, verify cert
    if cert good, continue connection 
    if cert bad, disconnect 
  if no, enlist user
